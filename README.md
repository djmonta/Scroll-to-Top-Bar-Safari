# Scroll to Top Bar (Safari Extension)

Inspired by the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scroll-to-top-bar-bbmod/ejopjkiccflkkaepdhekkdhknokigddo)  
Inserts a small bar at the top of every page. You can click on this bar to return to the top of the page, just like on the iPhone.
